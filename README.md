# Project 2 - RISC-V Neural Network

This project implements a simple neural network which is able to classify handwritten digits. As inputs, it uses the MNIST data set, which is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 images containing handwritten digits ranging from 0-9. These images are treated as “flattened” input vectors of size 784 (= 28 * 28).
